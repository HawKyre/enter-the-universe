# Enter the Universe

This is an old project of mine where I attempt to create a 2D top-down game where the player can travel through different worlds.
As of now, there's a saving system implemented, as well as some world and tree generation, a generic item system which allows for simple addition of items, item dropping and collection, a simple inventory, procedural world generation, teletransportation between worlds and probably other things that I've forgotten.
